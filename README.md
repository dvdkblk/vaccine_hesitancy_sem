# Reactance in the context of Covid-19 vaccines 

Reactance is the "_aversive motivation state that energizes individuals to restore their threatened or lost freedom in a way of asserting their autonomy_" (Quick and Stephenson 2007). This concept becomes relevant as governments are considering or are already implementing vaccine mandates to face the challenges of the covid-19 pandemic. Taking into account the possibility of reactance, one might expect that imposing vaccine mandates could lead to a lower willingness to get vaccinated.  
Sprengholz et al. used sum scores and multivariate regression to investigate this question in their study. They were able to verify all of their hypotheses (see picture below). I applied Structural Equation Modeling, a more complex modeling technique, to replicate their results.

In a first step I analyzed weither the question items provided plausible measurement models of the latent variables, something the original authors simply assumed. For example I tested if the measurements were equally reliable in the two treatment groups. Some modifications were made, but generally the question items were useful to construct latent factors.
